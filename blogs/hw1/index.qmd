## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

This study investigate whether the presence and size of a matching grant—commonly used by nonprofits—significantly affects donor behavior. The matching grant acts as a potential price reduction for donating, which may alter individuals’ willingness to give. The experiment’s large sample and randomized design make it especially well-suited to test economic theories of altruism, incentives, and social signaling.

This project seeks to replicate the core findings of Karlan and List (2007), using the original dataset provided by the authors. Through our replication, I aim to confirm their main results, including how matching grants affect both the likelihood of donating and the average amount donated. I also explore potential heterogeneity in treatment effects by political geography, as highlighted in the original paper.

## Data

### Description

This dataset comes from a large-scale natural field experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007) to study the impact of different fundraising strategies on charitable donations. It contains data from over 50,000 past donors to a U.S.-based nonprofit organization who were randomly assigned to receive one of several types of solicitation letters.

Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a single individual donor. The dataset includes variables that capture:

    - Treatment assignment, including whether the donor received a matching grant offer and the specific match ratio (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1).
    - Suggested donation amounts, which were manipulated as part of the experimental design.
    - Donation behavior, such as whether the person donated in response, and how much they gave.
    - Demographic indicators and prior donation history (e.g., years since first gift, total number of past donations, gender).
    - Geographic and political indicators, such as whether the donor lived in a “red” or “blue” state during the 2004 presidential election, and the level of activity of the organization in that state.

### Balance Test 

As an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.

_todo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)._

To do this, I performed t-tests on a set of baseline variables using the formula:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}_T - \bar{X}_C}{\sqrt{\frac{s_T^2}{n_T} + \frac{s_C^2}{n_C}}}
\]

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

treated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]

table1_vars = [
    'mrm2',    
    'hpa',      
    'freq',      
    'years',     
    'year5',     
    'female', 'couple',
    'redcty',
    'nonlit', 'cases'
]

def manual_ttest(var):
    Xt, Xc = treated[var], control[var]
    mean_diff = Xt.mean() - Xc.mean()
    pooled_se = np.sqrt(Xt.var(ddof=1)/len(Xt) + Xc.var(ddof=1)/len(Xc))
    t_stat = mean_diff / pooled_se
    return {
        "Variable": var,
        "Mean_Treatment": round(Xt.mean(), 3),
        "Mean_Control": round(Xc.mean(), 3),
        "t-stat": round(t_stat, 4)
    }

manual_ttest_df = pd.DataFrame([manual_ttest(v) for v in table1_vars])
manual_ttest_df
```

This table replicates the balance check presented in Table 1 of Karlan & List (2007), using a manual t-test formula to compare pre-treatment characteristics across the treatment and control groups. The variables cover donor behavior (e.g., months since last donation, prior contributions), demographics (e.g., gender, race, household size), and political/geographic indicators (e.g., red state/county, legal involvement of the organization). Across all tested variables, the t-statistics remain small (generally below ±2), and none of the differences reach conventional levels of statistical significance. This provides strong evidence that the treatment assignment was effectively randomized and groups are balanced on observable characteristics. This confirms the reliability of the experiment design and supports the validity of later comparisons on donation behavior.

```{python}
from tabulate import tabulate
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

reg_results = []
for var in table1_vars:
    model = smf.ols(f"{var} ~ treatment", data=df).fit()
    reg_results.append([
        var,
        round(model.params["treatment"], 4),
        round(model.pvalues["treatment"], 4),
        round(model.rsquared, 4)
    ])

headers = ["Variable", "Treatment Coef", "p-value", "R-squared"]
print(tabulate(reg_results, headers=headers, tablefmt="github"))
```

This regression-based balance check complements the earlier t-tests by estimating the relationship between treatment assignment and baseline covariates. For each variable, we regress it on the `treatment` indicator and inspect the coefficient and p-value. All p-values are well above the 0.05 threshold, confirming that treatment status is not significantly associated with any pre-treatment variable. This is consistent with the design of a randomized controlled trial, further supporting the internal validity of the experiment. The results also match those from the manual t-tests, which is expected since the regression with a binary independent variable produces the same mean difference and inference as a t-test.


## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

_todo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control._
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

donation_rates = df.groupby("treatment")["gave"].mean().rename({0: "Control", 1: "Treatment"})

donation_rates.plot(kind="bar", color=["gray", "orange"])
plt.title("Proportion of People Who Donated")
plt.ylabel("Donation Rate")
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.ylim(0, 0.05)  
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This plot displays the proportion of individuals who made a charitable contribution in the control and treatment groups. The donation rate is noticeably higher in the treatment group, indicating that the presence of a matching donation offer likely increased the likelihood of giving. This supports the hypothesis that matched donations can serve as an effective behavioral nudge in charitable fundraising.

_todo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)_

```{python}
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

treated = df[df['treatment'] == 1]
control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]

t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(treated["gave"], control["gave"], equal_var=False)

print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}, p-value: {p_val:.4f}")
```

```{python}
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

model = smf.ols("gave ~ treatment", data=df).fit()

from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Coef", model.params["treatment"]],
         ["p-value", model.pvalues["treatment"]],
         ["R-squared", model.rsquared]]
print(tabulate(table, headers=["Metric", "Value"], tablefmt="github"))
```

Both the t-test and linear regression show a statistically significant difference in donation behavior between the treatment and control groups. Individuals who received a letter mentioning a matching grant were more likely to donate than those who received a standard letter. This finding replicates Table 2a Panel A of Karlan & List (2007), and supports the hypothesis that matched donations act as a strong psychological motivator. From a behavioral standpoint, it suggests that people are more inclined to give when their contributions feel amplified — they may view their gift as having a greater impact, which encourages them to take action. This simple intervention—adding a match offer—significantly influenced behavior even though the individuals in both groups received similar messages aside from that detail.

_todo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper._
```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
from tabulate import tabulate

probit_model = smf.probit("gave ~ treatment", data=df).fit(disp=0)

probit_summary = [
    ["Coef", probit_model.params["treatment"]],
    ["p-value", probit_model.pvalues["treatment"]],
    ["Pseudo R-squared", probit_model.prsquared]
]
print(tabulate(probit_summary, headers=["Metric", "Value"], tablefmt="github"))
```

This probit regression estimates the effect of treatment assignment on the likelihood of making a donation, using a nonlinear model suitable for binary outcomes. The coefficient on the treatment variable is positive and statistically significant, indicating that individuals who received a matching gift message were more likely to donate. This result replicates the findings of Table 3, Column 1 in *Karlan & List (2007)*, providing further evidence that matching donations increase participation. While the probit coefficient itself isn’t directly interpretable as a percentage change, its sign and significance confirm the effect observed in the linear model and t-test. Together, these consistent results across models support the conclusion that match framing can significantly increase donor engagement in charitable campaigns.


### Differences between Match Rates

Next, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the "figures suggest" comment the authors make on page 8?_

```{python}
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

match_only = df[df["treatment"] == 1]

ratio1 = match_only[match_only["ratio"] == "ratio1"]
ratio2 = match_only[match_only["ratio"] == "ratio2"]
ratio3 = match_only[match_only["ratio"] == "ratio3"]

tests = {
    "2:1 vs 1:1": ttest_ind(ratio2["gave"], ratio1["gave"], equal_var=False),
    "3:1 vs 1:1": ttest_ind(ratio3["gave"], ratio1["gave"], equal_var=False),
    "3:1 vs 2:1": ttest_ind(ratio3["gave"], ratio2["gave"], equal_var=False),
}

import pandas as pd
ttest_results = pd.DataFrame([
    [k, round(v.statistic, 4), round(v.pvalue, 4)]
    for k, v in tests.items()
], columns=["Comparison", "t-statistic", "p-value"])

ttest_results
```

The t-tests above examine whether increasing the match ratio (from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1) significantly affects the probability of donating. The results show that the differences in donation rates are not statistically significant** at conventional levels. This finding aligns with the authors' comment on page 8 of Karlan & List (2007), where they state that "the figures suggest that higher match ratios did not lead to significantly greater giving rates." Despite intuitive expectations, offering a 2:1 or 3:1 match did not lead to more people donating compared to a 1:1 match. This suggests that the psychological impact of having any match available may be more important than the generosity of the multiplier itself.

_todo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable `ratio1` then regress `gave` on `ratio1`, `ratio2`, and `ratio3` (or alternatively, regress `gave` on the categorical variable `ratio`). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision._
```{python}
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
from tabulate import tabulate

matched = df[df["treatment"] == 1]

model = smf.ols("gave ~ C(ratio)", data=matched).fit()

summary_table = [
    ["Intercept (ratio1)", model.params["Intercept"], model.pvalues["Intercept"]],
    ["ratio2", model.params.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio2]", 0), model.pvalues.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio2]", 1)],
    ["ratio3", model.params.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio3]", 0), model.pvalues.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio3]", 1)],
]
print(tabulate(summary_table, headers=["Term", "Coef", "p-value"], tablefmt="github"))
```

This regression estimates the donation probability under different match ratios, using `ratio1` (1:1 match) as the baseline category. The intercept represents the average donation rate for the 1:1 group, while the coefficients for `ratio2` and `ratio3` represent the change in probability relative to that baseline. The results confirm that there are no statistically significant differences in donation rates when comparing 2:1 or 3:1 match ratios to the 1:1 ratio. These coefficients are close to zero and accompanied by large p-values, reinforcing the earlier t-test findings. In line with the authors' interpretation, this suggests that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not further motivate giving** — the existence of a match alone may be the primary driver of behavioral change, rather than its size.


_todo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios.  Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?_

```{python}
coef_ratio1 = model.params["Intercept"]
coef_ratio2 = model.params.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio2]", 0)
coef_ratio3 = model.params.get("C(ratio)[T.ratio3]", 0)

diff_2vs1 = coef_ratio2
diff_3vs2 = coef_ratio3 - coef_ratio2

import pandas as pd
response_diff = pd.DataFrame({
    "Comparison": ["2:1 vs 1:1", "3:1 vs 2:1"],
    "Difference in Fitted Rate": [round(diff_2vs1, 5), round(diff_3vs2, 5)]
})

response_diff
```

This table shows the difference in predicted donation rates based on the fitted values from the regression model.
    - The difference between the 2:1 and 1:1 match groups is very small and not statistically significant.
    - The difference between the 3:1 and 2:1 groups is similarly negligible.

These findings provide further evidence that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not meaningfully increase the likelihood of donating. The presence of a match appears to matter, but its size does not — supporting the idea that the psychological nudge of a match is more about its existence than its magnitude. This aligns with the interpretation found in *Karlan & List (2007)*, where the authors argue that the offer of any match (even 1:1) seems sufficient to trigger the intended behavioral response.


### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?_

_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ 

_todo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._


## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers

_to do:  Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means._


### Central Limit Theorem

_to do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the "middle" of the distribution or whether it's in the "tail."_
