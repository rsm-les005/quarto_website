        "\n",
        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "This study investigate whether the presence and size of a matching grant—commonly used by nonprofits—significantly affects donor behavior. The matching grant acts as a potential price reduction for donating, which may alter individuals’ willingness to give. The experiment’s large sample and randomized design make it especially well-suited to test economic theories of altruism, incentives, and social signaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project seeks to replicate the core findings of Karlan and List (2007), using the original dataset provided by the authors. Through the replication, I aim to confirm their main results, including how matching grants affect both the likelihood of donating and the average amount donated. I also explore potential heterogeneity in treatment effects by political geography, as highlighted in the original paper.\n",

        "## Data\n",

        "### Description\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset comes from a large-scale natural field experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007) to study the impact of different fundraising strategies on charitable donations. It contains data from over 50,000 past donors to a U.S.-based nonprofit organization who were randomly assigned to receive one of several types of solicitation letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a single individual donor. The dataset includes variables that capture:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Treatment assignment including whether the donor received a matching grant offer and the specific match ratio (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1).\n",
        "    - Suggested donation amounts which were manipulated as part of the experimental design.\n",
        "    - Donation behavior such as whether the person donated in response, and how much they gave.\n",
        "    - Demographic indicators and prior donation history (e.g., years since first gift, total number of past donations, gender).\n",
        "    - Geographic and political indicators such as whether the donor lived in a “red” or “blue” state during the 2004 presidential election, and the level of activity of the organization in that state.\n",

Across all tested variables, the t-statistics remain small (generally below ±2), and none of the differences reach conventional levels of statistical significance.

For each variable, we regress it on the `treatment` indicator and inspect the coefficient and p-value. All p-values are well above the 0.05 threshold, confirming that treatment status is not significantly associated with any pre-treatment variable. This is consistent with the design of a randomized controlled trial, further supporting the internal validity of the experiment. The results also match those from the manual t-tests, which is expected since the regression with a binary independent variable produces the same mean difference and inference as a t-test.\n",

The estimated coefficient on `treatment` now reflects the difference in average gift size conditional on donating. The result shows that the treatment has very little effect on the amount donated among those who gave something — the coefficient is small and statistically insignificant. This finding supports the idea that the matching grant mainly affects the decision to donate, not the amount donated once that decision is made. In other words, treatment increases the extensive margin (whether to give), but not the intensive margin (how much to give). Regarding causal interpretation: since treatment was randomly assigned, and we're conditioning on an outcome (`gave`), the estimate does not have a strict causal interpretation. It's subject to selection bias — those who gave in treatment might be different in unobservable ways from those who gave in control. So we interpret this descriptively rather than causally."

Each point on the blue line shows the average difference in outcomes after that many paired observations. As the sample size increases, the average stabilizes — a clear demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers in action. The dashed red line marks the true difference in the population, and we see that the sample-based average gets increasingly close to it.
